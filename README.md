## WTWR (What to Wear?) Back-End

The back-end of the WTWR (What to Wear?) application serves as the core infrastructure for managing user authentication, clothing items, and their likes. This API-based server allows users to securely sign up, log in, and manage their profiles, as well as add and interact with clothing items.

This back-end is built to interact with a MongoDB database and provides routes for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting clothing items. Users can also "like" items, and the server is protected by JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication.
